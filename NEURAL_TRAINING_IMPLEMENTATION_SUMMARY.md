### Progress Tracking, Parallel Processing, and Caching Plan

**Progress Tracking (COMPLETE):**
- âœ… The evaluation system now supports real-time progress updates via a `progress_callback` passed to the evaluator.
- âœ… The backend updates the evaluation session's `progress` field as each phase completes.
- âœ… The frontend can poll the status endpoint to display live progress.
- âœ… Progress updates are shown for each evaluation phase: inference speed, position accuracy, move agreement, win rate, and comparisons.
- âœ… Real-time monitoring shows completion status and elapsed time.
- âœ… Evaluation sessions are properly serialized and stored in the backend.

**Parallel Processing (Planned):**
- Future versions will support parallelizing position and game evaluation using threads or async workers.
- This will allow much faster evaluation, especially on multi-core systems.

**Caching (Planned):**
- Results of neural and heuristic evaluations will be cached to avoid redundant computation.
- This will speed up repeated evaluations and allow for more efficient batch analysis.
