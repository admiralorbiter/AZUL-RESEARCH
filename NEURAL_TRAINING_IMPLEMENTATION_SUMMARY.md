3. **Start Training**: Click the prominent "ðŸš€ Start Training" button
4. **Monitor Progress**: Switch to "Training Monitor" tab for live visualization
5. **View Loss Curve**: See real-time loss progression over epochs
6. **Monitor Resources**: Track CPU and memory usage during training
7. **Manage Sessions**: View all sessions, stop training, or delete completed sessions
8. **Save Configuration**: Use "ðŸ’¾ Save Configuration" to persist settings

## ðŸ“‹ **Next Steps (Part 2.1.3)**

- **Model Evaluation Interface**: Performance metrics and comparison tools
- **Advanced Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall for model evaluation
- **Model Comparison**: Side-by-side model performance comparison
- **Export Results**: Save evaluation results and reports
