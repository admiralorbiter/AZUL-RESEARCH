## 🏗️ **Architecture**

### **Core Components**
1. **`core/azul_scoring_optimization.py`** - Main scoring optimization engine
2. **`api/routes.py`** - REST API endpoint (`/api/v1/detect-scoring-optimization`)

### **Data Flow**
```
Game State → Scoring Optimizer → API → UI Component → User Display
```

## 🔧 **Implementation Details**

### **Scoring Optimization Engine (`core/azul_scoring_optimization.py`)**

The `AzulScoringOptimizer` class analyzes game states to identify scoring opportunities:

```python
class AzulScoringOptimizer:
    def __init__(self, urgency_threshold=0.6):
        self.urgency_threshold = urgency_threshold
    
    def detect_scoring_optimization(self, state: AzulState, current_player: int) -> ScoringOptimization:
        # Main detection method
        pass
```

#### **Key Methods:**

- **`detect_scoring_optimization()`** - Main entry point for scoring analysis
- **`_detect_wall_completion_opportunities()`** - Identifies wall completion scenarios
- **`_detect_pattern_line_optimization()`** - Analyzes pattern line opportunities
- **`_detect_floor_line_optimization()`** - Analyzes floor line management
- **`_detect_endgame_multipliers()`** - Identifies endgame scoring setups

### **Wall Completion Detection**

The system identifies wall completion opportunities by:

1. **Analyzing wall state** - Checking which tiles are placed on the wall
2. **Calculating completion needs** - Determining tiles needed for completion
3. **Assessing bonus values** - Evaluating the points for each completion type
4. **Calculating urgency** - Scoring the importance of the opportunity

#### **Completion Types:**

- **Row completion**: 4 tiles in a row, 1 tile needed (+2 points)
- **Column completion**: 4 tiles in a column, 1 tile needed (+7 points)
- **Color set completion**: 4 tiles of same color, 1 tile needed (+10 points)

#### **Urgency Calculation**

Urgency is calculated based on multiple factors:

```python
def _calculate_completion_urgency(self, tiles_needed: int, bonus_points: int, 
                                tiles_available: int) -> float:
    # Bonus urgency: higher bonus = higher urgency
    bonus_urgency = min(bonus_points / 10.0, 1.0)
    
    # Availability urgency: fewer tiles available = higher urgency
    availability_ratio = min(tiles_available / tiles_needed, 2.0) if tiles_needed > 0 else 0
    availability_urgency = 1.0 - (availability_ratio / 2.0)
    
    # Combine factors
    urgency = (bonus_urgency * 0.7) + (availability_urgency * 0.3)
    return min(1.0, urgency)
```

### **Pattern Line Optimization**

The system analyzes pattern line opportunities by:

1. **Checking pattern line state** - Current tiles in each pattern line
2. **Calculating completion value** - Points for completing the line
3. **Assessing overflow risk** - Risk of tiles going to floor line
4. **Evaluating timing** - Early vs. late game considerations

### **Floor Line Management**

The system analyzes floor line optimization by:

1. **Counting current floor tiles** - Current penalty level
2. **Assessing additional risk** - Potential penalties from new tiles
3. **Identifying recovery opportunities** - Wall placements that clear floor
4. **Calculating risk/reward** - Trade-offs between scoring and penalties

### **API Integration**

The scoring optimization is exposed via a REST API endpoint:

```python
@api_bp.route('/detect-scoring-optimization', methods=['POST'])
def detect_scoring_optimization():
    # Handles scoring optimization requests
    # Returns JSON with opportunities and move suggestions
```

#### **Request Format:**
```json

    "fen_string": "wall_completion_opportunity",
    "current_player": 0,
    "include_wall_completion": true,
    "include_pattern_line_optimization": true,
    "include_floor_line_optimization": true,
    "urgency_threshold": 0.6
}
```

#### **Response Format:**
```json

    "wall_completion_opportunities": [
        {
            "type": "color_set",
            "color": "red",

            }
        ]
    }

## 🎯 **Algorithm Details**

### **Scoring Detection Algorithm**

1. **Wall completion analysis:**
   - Check each row, column, and color for completion opportunities
   - Calculate bonus points for each completion type
   - Assess tile availability for completion
   - Calculate urgency based on bonus value and availability

2. **Pattern line analysis:**
   - Check each pattern line for completion opportunities
   - Calculate scoring value for completion
   - Assess overflow risk to floor line
   - Evaluate timing considerations

3. **Floor line analysis:**
   - Count current floor tiles and penalties
   - Identify recovery opportunities through wall placement
   - Calculate risk/reward for additional floor tiles
   - Assess timing for floor line management

4. **Endgame multiplier analysis:**
   - Identify opportunities for multiple bonuses
   - Calculate tile requirements for planned bonuses
   - Assess timing and risk of multiplier setups

### **Scoring Priority Factors**

- **Bonus value (70% weight)**: Higher bonuses get higher priority
- **Tile availability (30% weight)**: Scarcer tiles increase urgency
- **Timing considerations**: Early vs. late game impact
- **Risk assessment**: Floor line penalties and overflow risk
