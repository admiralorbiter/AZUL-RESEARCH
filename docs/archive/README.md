# 📚 Documentation Archive

This directory contains archived documentation files that have been consolidated into the main documentation structure.

## 📁 Archive Structure

### `/progress/`
Contains individual milestone progress files that have been consolidated into `PROGRESS_SUMMARY.md`:
- Individual milestone progress summaries (M1-M7)
- Component-specific progress reports
- Detailed implementation notes

### `/planning/`
Contains individual planning files that have been consolidated into `PLANNING_SUMMARY.md`:
- Epic planning summaries
- Component-specific planning documents
- Detailed planning notes and checklists

## 🔄 Consolidation Notes

The documentation has been reorganized to provide:
- **Consolidated Progress Summary**: All milestone information in one place
- **Consolidated Planning Summary**: All planning information in one place
- **Current Status**: Up-to-date information reflecting M1-M6 completion and M7 progress
- **Reduced Redundancy**: Eliminated duplicate information across multiple files

## 📋 Accessing Archived Files

If you need to reference specific details from the archived files:
1. Check the consolidated summaries first (`PROGRESS_SUMMARY.md`, `PLANNING_SUMMARY.md`)
2. If specific details are needed, refer to the appropriate archived file
3. The main documentation (`README.md`, `DOCUMENTATION_STATUS.md`) contains current status

**Note**: The archived files are kept for historical reference but are no longer actively maintained. Current project status is reflected in the main documentation files.
