**How to use**:
1. **Check risk levels** before taking tiles
2. **Consider timing** - when is the best time to take these tiles?
3. **Plan recovery** if penalties are unavoidable
4. **Balance risk vs. reward** with other opportunities

## üéØ **Move Quality Assessment Usage**

### **Running Move Quality Analysis**

#### **Step 1: Set Up Position**
1. **Load or create a position** with multiple move options
2. **Ensure position is valid** and follows Azul rules
3. **Identify the player** to analyze (usually yourself)

#### **Step 2: Run Quality Assessment**
1. **Click "Analyze Move Quality"** in the analysis tools
2. **Wait for evaluation** - may take longer for complex positions
3. **Review quality tiers** (!!, !, =, ?!, ?) for all moves

#### **Step 3: Study Results**
1. **Check top recommendations** and their quality scores
2. **Read explanations** for why moves are rated as they are
3. **Compare alternatives** to understand trade-offs
4. **Consider situational factors** (score, timing, etc.)

### **Understanding Quality Tiers**

#### **!! (Brilliant Move) - 90-100 points**
- **Characteristics**: Multiple high-value objectives, minimal risk
- **When to play**: Critical positions, game-winning opportunities
- **Examples**: Completing wall while blocking opponent and setting up multiplier

#### **! (Excellent Move) - 75-89 points**
- **Characteristics**: Primary strategic objective achieved, good risk/reward
- **When to play**: Strong positions, clear strategic advantages
- **Examples**: Efficient wall completion with bonus, strong blocking moves

#### **= (Good/Solid Move) - 50-74 points**
- **Characteristics**: Reasonable, safe, doesn't harm position
- **When to play**: Neutral positions, maintenance moves
- **Examples**: Standard pattern line filling, safe tile collection

#### **?! (Dubious Move) - 25-49 points**
- **Characteristics**: Some benefit but significant downsides
- **When to avoid**: When better alternatives exist
- **Examples**: Unnecessary floor line penalties, missed blocking opportunities

#### **? (Poor Move) - 0-24 points**
- **Characteristics**: Clear mistakes with negative impact
- **When to avoid**: Almost always - look for alternatives
- **Examples**: Helping opponent complete patterns, severe penalties
