# Neural Training Interface Planning

**Status**: IMPLEMENTATION IN PROGRESS - Part 2.1.1 Complete, Background Training Implemented

## Overview

The Neural Training Interface is a dedicated page within the Azul Research application that provides comprehensive tools for training, monitoring, and evaluating neural network models for Azul game analysis. This interface is designed to be scalable and extensible for future neural network features.

## Architecture

- **Dedicated Page**: Separate route (`/neural`) with tab-based navigation

    loss REAL,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (session_id) REFERENCES neural_training_sessions(session_id)
);
```

### neural_models
```sql

    model_path TEXT,
    config JSON,
    training_session_id TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,

## Progress Tracking

### Completed Features
1. **Routing Structure**: Implemented dedicated neural training page with navigation
2. **UI/UX Improvements**: Enhanced button visibility, added progress indicators
3. **Background Processing**: Resolved `net::ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` errors by implementing non-blocking training
4. **Real-time Updates**: Added status polling and progress tracking
5. **Error Handling**: Improved error messages and user feedback
6. **Training Controls**: Added stop training functionality

### Technical Implementation
- **Backend**: Background threading with session management
- **Frontend**: Status polling with 2-second intervals
- **API**: RESTful endpoints for training, status, and control
- **State Management**: React state for training configuration and progress

### Current Progress: 60% Complete
- Part 2.1.1: âœ… 100% Complete
- Part 2.1.2: ðŸ”„ 40% Complete (background processing done, UI enhancements in progress)
- Part 2.1.3: ðŸ“‹ 0% Complete
- Part 2.1.4: ðŸ“‹ 0% Complete
- Part 2.1.5: ðŸ“‹ 0% Complete

## Implementation Notes

### Error Resolution
**Issue**: `net::ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` and `TypeError: Failed to fetch` errors when starting training
**Root Cause**: Synchronous blocking training process causing client connection timeouts
**Solution**: Implemented background threading with session-based status tracking
**Result**: Training now starts immediately and provides real-time progress updates

### Key Technical Achievements
1. **Non-blocking Training**: Training runs in background threads, server remains responsive
2. **Session Management**: Unique session IDs for tracking multiple training sessions
3. **Real-time Status**: Progress updates, logs, and results via polling
4. **User Controls**: Stop training functionality with immediate feedback
5. **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of network errors and training failures
